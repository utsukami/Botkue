The RS Comanpaion mobile/web app will be shut down on the release of OSRS Mobile. Since the entire game is becoming an app, there's no need for them to continue maintaining RS Companion. This app is how I was grabbing data for the tracking of rankings in CC's. Until I figure out another way to grab the needed data, I don't have much motivation to improve this project.
